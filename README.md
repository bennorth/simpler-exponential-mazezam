# Simpler exponential Mazezam level family

A simpler demo of how the solution to a MazezaM level can be exponential in its size.  Simplification due to [Aaron Williams](http://simons-rock.edu/faculty/aaron-williams).

See [the write-up and demo](https://bennorth.github.io/simpler-exponential-mazezam/index.html) for more, and [the write-up and demo of the previous version](https://bennorth.github.io/exponential-mazezam/index.html) for comparison.
